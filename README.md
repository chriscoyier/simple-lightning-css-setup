## What?

A minimal build process example of using [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/) (alone) having it run when CSS files change, as well as refresh the page when changes are detected.

## Spin it up.

Make sure to start the build process in a terminal:

```
npm run dev
```

And to serve it, you can do this in another terminal:

```
npx serve
```
